#### This is a streamlit web app built for the Data Kind SNAP & Benefit Data Trust Volunteer Research 

#### I am building this streamlit to create awareness about the states and counties in the USA that are still yet to benefit from the SNAP Program, and this web app will help the BDT team understand which location to focus on, and helping the people living in that location gain access to SNAP Program.
